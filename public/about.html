<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am new to web development but I have always had an interest 
  in it since I was a young child but I was unsure how to get 
  involved in it until about a year ago when my brother showed 
  my a few websites like Codecedemy and Udemy. I am currently 
  in the middle of creating my own website from my favourite 
  TV show criminal minds and hoping to put it online when I am 
  finished. I have learnt a lot of HTML 5 and currently learning 
  more about CSS and will eventually move on to JavaScript. </p>

<p>I have 10 years of experience in customer service whether 
  that is via email, phone or via video call. I have gained 
  this experience in a number of different jobs from my first 
  at Morrisons at 17 years old to my last job at Harwoods.</p>

<p>I am 28 years old; I enjoy gaming which include Gears of War,
  Call of duty cold war and vanguard, Fortnite, Disney Dreamlight
  Valley and many more. Also, I enjoy reading, I am currently reading
  Sheâ€™s in Ctrl by Anne-Marie Imafidon and a book by Rebecca Yarros 
  called The Fourth Wing. Mainly, at the moment I am teaching myself
  code which I enjoy very much.</p>

<h1>The best movies according to Amy Rolfe</h1>

<H2>My top 3 movies of all-time</H2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers</h3>
<p>The acting in this movie is incredible
   as well as the graphics. For example, the battle 
   at the end of the movie looks so real. For me, its
   my favourite movie of all time.</p>

<h3>Harry potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</h3>
<p>This is in my top 3 as I grew up on harry potter 
    the books and the movies. The last movie just
    made me emotional and it felt like my childhood
    was over when this movie ended. I had grown up with
    this series.</p>

<h3>Me Before You</h3>
<p>I enjoy a love story movie and this movie has it 
    all. The romantic story telling with the emotional
    realism of what life has to offer. It did make
    me cry so bring tissues.</p>
